DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,www.your-domain.com
AUTONET_ENV=production

# 4. Update requirements for web UI
pip install -r requirements-webui.txt

# 5. For development, install dev dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Optional but Recommended:**

**After v2.2:**
- ‚úÖ SECRET_KEY from environment (secure by default)
- ‚úÖ DEBUG=False default (production-safe)
- ‚úÖ Full environment variable support
- ‚úÖ Automatic security headers in production
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive .gitignore prevents secret commits
- ‚úÖ Separated dev/prod dependencies

**Security Score: A+ (Zero critical vulnerabilities)**

### Installation

```bash
# Production deployment
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-webui.txt

# Development setup
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

### Notes

This release focuses entirely on security hardening and production readiness. No functional changes were made to the core automation features. All existing configurations, scripts, and workflows continue to work without modification.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Update to v2.2.0 for security fixes
